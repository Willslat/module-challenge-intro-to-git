Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions.

A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? A distributed version control system that monitors and controls code changes made during development across several people or teams.
